# Python Challenge Container
Ubuntu based docker image with some python packages pre-installed. If you need any other package, you need to include the source files it in your submission zip. Also, keep in mind that there is no display connected to the systems running your code so don't call any functions that open a window (ex: `plt.show()`).

Installed Python Packages:
```
numpy==1.18.5
matplotlib==3.3.2
scipy==1.5.2
scikit-learn==0.23.2
plotly==4.11.0
torch==1.6.0
tensorflow==2.3.1
seaborn==0.11.0
keras==2.4.3
